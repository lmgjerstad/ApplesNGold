# Apples'n'Gold

Apples'n'Gold is a simple console computer game written by Adrian Gjerstad and Lance Gjerstad. This game has many fun aspects to it, and is being built on day after day. For example, a shop, prestiging, trades, and many more things! Here on GitHub, you are able to view the code that makes it possible! This game is originally by [CodeDojo](https://github.com/CodeDojoOfficial), and it grows alongside it. Adrian is a part of CodeDojo, so no copyright infringement is made.

# Help (v1.0.0)

When you start, you will see a prompt asking you for your name. Whatever name you enter will be the name of the save file that it creates, so make sure you enter the same thing every time. Now, let's play!

When you start up, you will be met with many different options.

```
Apples: 0
Gold: 0

1: Pick 1 apple
2: Sell 0 apples for 0 gold
3: Go to the shop
Enter a number OR q/Q to quit.


```

The only good option for you right now, is option 1, pick an apple. So, as the prompt says, enter the number 1 to pick an apple. Congratulations! You now have an apple! You can now sell that apple, or keep going till you see a good price! Judge a good price based off knowing that your gold will be given to you at the rate of a random number between 0.25 and 0.5 gold.

Once you have enough gold, you can enter the shop, and buy tools! Again, this is that same menu layout, but with the shop. So you should know what to do here. When you are done, hit q or Q to go back. Now, look carefully at your first option's description. You can now harvest multiple apples at once! Go ahead and keep doing this as long as you want.

(SPOILER ALERT)

At some point, you will find a strange fourth option, along with a new, cyan blue stat at the top.

```
Platinum: 0

...

4: Would you like to prestige for 13 platinum?
```

*Note: The amount of platinum for a prestige may be different.*

Platinum gives you a +0.01 gold per sale of apples. So if you have 50, it is possible to get 1 full gold for an apple!

If it gets to the point where it becomes boring, go ahead and contribute here at GitHub by asking for new features!
